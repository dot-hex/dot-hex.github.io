# Miyeon 60

## General Information

A 60% top mount design, this board has simple side cuts and a Matrix inspired bottom edge. As with all of my boards, heavy filleting on the top piece makes the top edge soft to the touch while typing.

This board has a brass weight with a cutthrough SS insert. It is a personal design.
