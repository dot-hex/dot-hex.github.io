# The AB-TK PCB

## Overview

A universal TK PCB designed and distributed by Reddit/Geekhack user u/niceandcreamy. Alernatively known as the Creamy AB.TK PCB. From what I have gathered, this was a custom pcb designed for use in TKLs such as the TX-84/87 and similar Korean custom boards circa 2018. This was originally designed for the TKL compatability list. The PCB was created specifically for clients of Creamy's keyboard building business. Per Creamy, only 3 or 4 were ever distributed. This did not include the Numpad and breakaway portions originally (as I did not have them on my PCB).

## Information about the Current Build
The current version firmware is based on a kbfirmware json created by creamy as part of their initial rollout of prototypes. It is based on a json generously provided by Discord user badnews. It appears this pcb never entered widespread distribution, so this will likely stay on a personal repo unless distribution resumes. Based on my conversation with u/niceandcreamy; based on my conversation with them, I do not believe distribution will resume.
